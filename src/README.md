# Todo Example: Svelte Edition

## The goal

To demonstrate how to build a simple todo app with Svelte to compare to other frameworks

## The concepts

This app should demonstrate the following

- Initial setup (how easy was the initial setup of the application, what were the pain points)
- Syntax (What does a component look like)
- Common patterns (loop-based & conditional rendering)
- Framework API usage (what are the APIs that would commonly be used in an application)
- Component reuse (how would a component be implemented to be reusable)
- Inter-component communication (input & output bindings)
- Lifecycle hooks (how are lifecycle hooks used to do component setup and teardown)
- and more...

## Requirements

- Set up a new basic application with Svelte/Solid
- The application should use typescript
- The application should use `localStorage` to load todo state from previous sessions
- The application should be built using Atomic Design priciples (small reusable components)
- Todos should be able to be marked complete, marked incomplete, and deleted
- The design should be roughly based off of [insert link here]
  - If you want, feel free to put your own design spin on it as long as everything still functions as it should 
- The application should use yarn as a it's package manager
